### Description
The *Viral Eukaryotic Bacterial Archaeal* (VEBA) is an open-source software suite developed with all domains of microorganisms as the primary objective (not *post hoc* adjustments) including prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral organisms.  VEBA is an end-to-end metagenomics analysis suite that can directly address eukaryotic and viral genomes in addition to prokaryotic genomes with support for CPR. VEBA implements a novel iterative binning procedure and hybrid sample-specific/multisample framework.  To optimize the microeukaryotic gene calling and taxonomic classifications, VEBA includes a consensus microeukaryotic database containing protists and fungi from several existing databases. VEBA also provides a unique clustering-based dereplication strategy allowing for sample-specific genomes and genes to be directly compared across non-overlapping biological samples.  In addition, VEBA automates the detection of candidate phyla radiation bacteria and implements the appropriate genome quality assessments for said organisms.

### Output structure
*VEBA*'s is built on the [*GenoPype*](https://github.com/jolespin/genopype) archituecture which creates a reproducible and easy-to-navigate directory structure.  *GenoPype*'s philosophy is to use the same names for all files but to have sample names as subdirectories.  This makes it easier to glob files for grepping, concatenating, etc. 

Here is an example of *GenoPype*'s layout:

```
# Project directory
project_directory/

# Temporary directory
project_directory/tmp/

# Log directory
project_directory/logs/
project_directory/logs/[step]__[program-name].e
project_directory/logs/[step]__[program-name].o
project_directory/logs/[step]__[program-name].returncode

# Checkpoint directory
project_directory/checkpoints/
project_directory/checkpoints/

# Intermediate directories for each step
project_directory/intermediate/
project_directory/intermediate/[step]__[program-name]/

# Output directory
project_directory/output/

# Commands
project_directory/commands.sh
```

For *VEBA*, it has all the directories created by `GenoPype` above but is built for having multiple samples under the same project:

```
ID="sample_1"

# Main output directory
veba_output/

# Assembly directory
veba_output/assembly

# Assembly output for ${ID} sample
veba_output/assembly/${ID}/output/

# Prokaryotic binning for ${ID} sample
veba_output/binning/prokaryotic/${ID}/output/ 

# Eukaryotic binning
veba_output/binning/eukaryotic/${ID}/output/

# Viral binning
veba_output/binning/viral/${ID}/output/
```

The above are default output locations but they can be customized.
